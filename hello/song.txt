[Varian:]
The path of hate is a dangerous track,
You take one step and it's hard to turn back.
It pulls you along
And though it seem wrong it feels right.

Don't you see this path you're on
Leaves a permanent mark?
It feels good at first,
Then it slowly turns dark
With each passing day
You're further astray from the light.

Suddenly you lose your way and lose the thread,
Lose your cool, then lose your head,
Every loss is harder to excuse.

Then you'll see you'll lose your faith and lose your soul
'til you lose complete control
And realize there's nothing left to lose.
Nothing left to lose.

Cass, trust me, becoming the villain isn't the answer.

[Cassandra:]
Is that what you think I am?

The path I'm on is a path paved in black,
I'm taking this road and I'm not looking back,
Each twist and each turn leads straight
Where I'm yearning to go.

Yes, it's true, my path is dark,
But I see where it ends,
My rivals will fall as my power ascends.
Despise me, that's fine:
I'm taking what's mine even so.

Not like you!
You lost your nerve, you lost the game,
But you and I, we're not the same.
I'm not lost, this fate was mine to choose.

So I chose to lose my doubts and lose my chains,
Lose each weakness that remains,
Now that I have nothing left to lose.
Nothing left to lose.

[Varian:]
You have so much to hold on to.

[Cassandra:]
I only want my rightful dues.

[Varian:]
Listen, please!
You've lost your grip and lost your mind.

[Cassandra:]
Lose? I'm not gonna lose!

[Varian:]
All's not lost, don't be so blind.

[Cassandra:]
I refuse.

[Varian:]
Cut your losses, drop the IOUs.

[Cassandra:]
I refuse.

[Varian:]
Oh, choose!

[Cassandra:]
I lose no tears and lose no sleep.
What I want I'll take and keep.

[Varian:]
It's time for you to choose.

[Cassandra:]
You can't stop.

[Cassandra&Varian:]
The turning of the screws.

[Cassandra:]
You'll stay in that cage until this is done.
And just in case you think of escaping...

Now I have nothing left to lose.
